## My process
	At my first attempt i was complicationg the process, using flexbox and css grid to try to center the card. I decided to restart and simply just added the card within the container and used margin: auto; to center it.
 The only issue i had in my second attempt was the image until i just gave in and gave it a height. Overall the process is simple and from what i can tell using google's dev tools, it's responsive and looks like the design.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

- I learned the importance of divs and how block elements work.
 <div class="container">
    <div class="card">
      <img src="#" alt="QR Code">
  <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>

  </div>
</div>

- Also learned about vh while figuring out how to center the conatainer.
.container{
    max-width: 325px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    margin-top: 20vh;
}


```

### Continued development

Although the solution I used was simple, I believe there's an easier way to do this project and I'll keep practicing till i find it. This project helped me realize that i need to focus a bit more on CSS.
